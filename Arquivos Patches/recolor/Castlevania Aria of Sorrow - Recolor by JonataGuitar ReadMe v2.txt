Castlevania Aria of Sorrow - Recolor by JonataGuitar
===========================================================================================================
A "basic" hack for Castlevania Aria of Sorrow that aims to overhaul the visuals of the game hopefully, make it more enjoyable for a fresh playthrough.  

ALL of the games Backgrounds, Animations, Characters, and Enemies have been recolored by JonataGuitar.

New to this update are TWO versions of the Recolor!  Please see below for quick details:

Recolor v1.02 Update:  This includes some bug fixes for Souls as well as some slight adjustments to more match the vanilla AoS Gameplay Experience.

Symphony of the Colors v1.0: A BRAND NEW Recolor by JonataGuitar that is inspired by the colors of the popular Symphony of the Night!

*QUICK NOTE* 

These patches are meant to recolor the palettes ONLY.  HOWEVER, the use of the two patches were tested (very briefly) with the ALTER patch for AoS.  

Initial testing seemed to have BOTH of the patches work fine, with no crashing/resets due to the cheat protection of the ALTER patch, leading one to believe they should be fine for a full playthrough, though YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY.

To use with ALTER, your AoS rom must be patched with ALTER FIRST, and THEN apply one of the Recolor Patches.
 
Not much else to say except for ENJOY!
